# A Simple Voting App

## The purpose of this app is to learn how to build a full-stack, dynamic web app, and to get experience implementing user authentication.

The app will allow you to create an account so you can come back to your data at a later time.

**Once you've created a user account, the app allows you to:**

Create new polls with any number of possible items and keep your polls so you can come back to them later.

It allows you to share your polls.

It allows you to see the aggregate results of your polls.

You can delete polls if you decide you don't want them anymore.

And you can change the options on your polls.

**The app allows anyone to:**

See and vote on everyone's polls.

And see the results of polls in chart form.
